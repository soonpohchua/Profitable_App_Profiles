#### About Profitable App Profiles

Profitable App Profiles is a guided project under Dataquest's Data Scientist in Python course.

##### Aim

The project aims to find mobile app profiles that are profitable for the App Store and Google Play markets so that the developers in our company can understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users. The company only builds apps that are free to download and install. Its main source of revenue consists of in-app ads which depend on the number of app users.

##### Data

As of Q2 2022, there were approximately 2.2 million iOS apps available on the App Store, and 3.5 million Android apps on Google Play. Given the cost and time to collect data for over 5 million apps, the project will tap on two sample data sets that are suitable for analysis.

- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) containing data about approximately ten thousand Android apps from Google Play. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/googleplaystore.csv).
- [A data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) containing data about approximately seven thousand iOS apps from the App Store. You can download the data set directly from [this link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/350/AppleStore.csv).
